# 🚀 Leveraging AI in Python to Automatically Identify Businesses by Address

In today’s digital era, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** plays a vital role in automating and enhancing business workflows.  
I recently developed a **Python-based tool** that integrates **OpenAI’s** model to extract public business information — using nothing but a physical address.

## 🔍 What Does This Tool Do?

- 💬 **Asks** an AI model what company (if any) is located at a given address  
- 🧾 **Returns** the business name, contact details, website, and a short description (if available)  
- ⏱️ **Saves time** by automating business lookup and verification  

---

## 💼 Potential Use Cases for Businesses

- ✅ **Verifying potential partners or vendors**  
- 📊 **Market research and competitor analysis**  
- 🗂️ **Automating the creation of customer/supplier databases**  
- 📈 **Enhancing sales and marketing intelligence**  

This project shows how AI can be seamlessly embedded into day-to-day operations, enabling **smarter decisions**, faster.

## 🧠 Python Code Example

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")

def find_business_by_address(address):
    prompt = f"""
    Can you tell me what business is located at this address, if public data is available?

    Address: {address}

    Please include the company name, phone number, website, and a brief description if possible.
    """
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="your_ai_model",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

address_input = input("Enter the address you'd like to search for: ")
result = find_business_by_address(address_input)
print("\n🧾 AI Response:\n")
print(result)
